//About installation of wallabag Instruction and Main problem face apart from original incident about migration database caused by sophistication in using MangoDB but now changed to simple SQLite.
//Main problem here is restriction of writing files block wallabag to run successfully

Updated yaml:
```
yaml

Copy
version: '3'
services:
  wallabag:
    image: wallabag/wallabag:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - SYMFONY__ENV__DATABASE_DRIVER=pdo_sqlite
      - SYMFONY__ENV__DOMAIN_NAME=http://localhost:8080
      - SYMFONY__ENV__FOSUSER_REGISTRATION=false
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./wallabag-data/data:/var/www/wallabag/data
      - ./wallabag-data/images:/var/www/wallabag/web/assets/images
```



Important Check:

```
Step 3: Check for Port Conflicts on 8080
If another program is using port 8080, Wallabag can’t use it.

Stop the container:
powershell

Copy
docker-compose down
Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser. If something loads, another app is using the port.
Or, check in PowerShell:
powershell

Copy
netstat -ano | findstr :8080
If you see output (e.g., TCP 0.0.0.0:8080), note the PID and check Task Manager to identify it.
If there’s a conflict: Edit docker-compose.yml, change 8080:80 to 8081:80, save, then run:
powershell

Copy
docker-compose up -d
Try http://localhost:8081 instead.
```


```
Check permissions:
Right-click wallabag-data > Properties > Security.
Ensure your user (or "Everyone") has "Full control."
If not, edit permissions, grant "Full control," and apply to subfolders.
```

>>>Grok review for possible problem:
```
You’re absolutely right that permissions on the data file were likely the culprit. The "ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE" error you saw was probably because Wallabag couldn't write to the database.sqlite file in the wallabag-data/data folder due to permission issues, which prevented the app from starting properly. By setting the correct permissions on the wallabag-data folder, Docker was able to create and access the SQLite database, and that did the trick.
```
